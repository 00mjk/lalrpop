# Version 0.7

This is mostly a bug-fix release.

Various minor issues were addressed:

- Issue #25: Unbalanced parens in string literals appearing in code now work properly.
- Issue #32: Regular expression parsing consumed infinite memory when a `.` appeared.
- Issue #34: Automatic tokenizer generation did not play well with generic type parameters.

# Older versions

I hadn't yet started writing release notes, sorry.
