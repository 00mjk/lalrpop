# LALRPOP

LALRPOP is a parser generator, similar in principle to [YACC], [ANTLR], [Menhir],
and other such programs. In general, it has the grand ambition of
being the most usable parser generator ever. This ambition is most
certainly not fully realized: right now, it's fairly standard, maybe
even a bit subpar in some areas. But hey, it's young. For the most
part, this README is intended to describe the current behavior of
LALRPOP, but in some places it includes notes for planned future
changes.
